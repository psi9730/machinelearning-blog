Paper review on "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for
Language Understanding(2018-10-11)"

## abstraction
* Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer
* wiki + BooksCorpus(total 3300M words) unlabeled data pre-training and labeled data transfer learning
* masked language models(MLM), next sentence prediction(NSP) on pre-training
* BERT advances the state of the art for eleven NLP tasks
* with few architecture change, small fine-tuning data and epochs
